# Backbone Input

A set of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) plugins related with input devices. 

Included here are the more stable versions of the plugins in one bundle. 

Active development is carried as seperate components at: 
[http://github.com/backbone-input](http://github.com/backbone-input)


## Install

To checkout the whole bundle, 
```
git clone git://github.com/makesites/backbone-input.git
cd backbone-input
```
and then initiate the submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

It is recommended though that you cherry pick the component you'd like to use instead of using the whole collection in you application.
